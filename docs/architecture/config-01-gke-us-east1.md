# Config 01 — GKE (us-east1) recommendations (low cost + small HA feel)

This config aims to keep costs low while still producing realistic failover behavior in dev.

---

## Cluster choice
- **GKE Standard, Regional**, region **us-east1**
- Release channel: **Regular**
- GitOps: **Argo CD**

---

## Dev node sizing (cheap)
Use burstable E2 shared-core where feasible.

**Dev baseline**
- Node type: `e2-medium` (small and stable enough for k8s overhead)
- Nodes: min **2**, max **6**

**Rationale**
- 2 nodes is the cheapest “HA feel” (pods reschedule, leaders move)
- Soft spreading rules will *try* to distribute replicas across nodes but won’t block scheduling.

---

## Staging / Prod
Start with the same layout but increase capacity as needed.

- Staging: min 2–3 nodes
- Prod: separate node pools recommended:
  - `app-pool` for stateless
  - `stateful-pool` for Postgres/NATS/Valkey/Keycloak DB

---

## Ingress + TLS
- `ingress-nginx`
- `cert-manager` (Let’s Encrypt)

Keep ingress portable to EKS.

---

## Secrets
- Staging/Prod: External Secrets Operator + GCP Secret Manager
- Dev/Local: SOPS (age) or local secrets (minimal)

---

## Cost levers (optional)
- Add a Spot node pool for stateless workloads later (BFF/WS/query), keep stateful on regular nodes.
