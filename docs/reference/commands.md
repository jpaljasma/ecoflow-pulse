# Reference: Commands

## Go Commands

```bash
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-smoke
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-server
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-mqtt-sub
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-pv-fingerprint
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-panel-db-import
go run ./cmd/ecoflow-panel-select-train
```

## Helper Scripts

```bash
./scripts/regenerate_solar_panel_db.sh
./scripts/train_panel_select_model.sh
```

Optional link map override for panel DB regeneration:

```bash
SOLAR_PANEL_LINK_MAP=data/solar_panels/panel_purchase_links_v13.json ./scripts/regenerate_solar_panel_db.sh
```

## Make Targets

```bash
make lint
make test
make bench
make build
make smoke
make mqtt
```

Notes:

- default `GOFLAGS` in `Makefile` include `-tags=moderncompress -mod=mod`,
- `make mqtt` exits cleanly on `q`/`Ctrl+C` and does not return non-zero on
  intentional stop.
